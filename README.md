üìñ Purpose: Provide a clear, comprehensive overview of your project for other developers, explaining what it is, how it works, and how to get it running.
Python AI Chatbot

ü§ñ Project Overview
This is a personal, full-stack chatbot built with Python. It's designed to be a comprehensive project that demonstrates how to create an AI-powered application from the ground up, with a focus on real-time communication and secure deployment.

The application leverages the power of OpenAI's language and image models to provide a dynamic and interactive user experience.

‚ú® Key Features
Real-time Chat: Utilizes WebSockets to provide instant, bi-directional communication between the client and server for a smooth chat experience.

AI-Powered Responses: Integrated with the OpenAI API to generate intelligent and context-aware responses.

Image Generation: The chatbot can also generate images from text descriptions using the DALL-E model.

Full-Stack Architecture: Built with a FastAPI backend for robust API endpoints and a Jinja2 templating engine for a clean, dynamic frontend.

Secure Deployment: Employs environmental variables to securely manage API keys, preventing sensitive information from being hardcoded or exposed in the codebase.

Hosted on Render: The application is deployed on Render, a PaaS that simplifies the deployment process and allows for easy scalability.
